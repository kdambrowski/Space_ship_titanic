# Description
Welcome to my project! This is a Machine Learning project made in Python. It allows users to quickly and easily add, verify and check best model to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.

## Data
All data and description about the case can be found on Kaggle.com. For more information about this data, please visit [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data).

## General Information
This project is a machine learning solution to the Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic". The goal of the project is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. 

## Technologies Used
* ydata_profiling 3.1.0
* xgboost 1.4.2
* lightgbm 3.2.1
* catboost 0.26.1
* ipywidgets 7.6.5
* optuna 2.9.1  
   
## Features
The project allows users to:
- Load the Titanic dataset
- Preprocess the data (e.g. handle missing values, encode categorical variables)
- Explore the data using the ydata_profiling package
- Train a variety of classification models using xgboost, lightgbm, and catboost
- Optimize model hyperparameters using optuna
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## Installation and Usage
To use this project, you must first install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Jupyter notebook and run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results presented in this project.

## Project Status
The project is currently in development.

## Room for Improvement
Areas that could be improved in the future include:
- Adding more data visualization tools
- Implementing more advanced preprocessing techniques
- Experimenting with more machine learning models
